    <p>Yes, it's pretty terrible. But we're going to turn it into responsive scrollytelling anyway.</p>

        <p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Each button should be turned into a step (scroll down to see them).</li>
          <li>When I resize, the graphic should scale to the <strong>width of its container, but not the height</strong>.</li>
          <li>It would be nice if you gave me a sentence to pretend this is a story instead of just "here's Africa!" Not that we have a strong story, of course.</li>

            <p>We are highlighting Asia in this step. This chart shows the life expectancy of Asian countries. Compared to the rest of the world, Asia is pretty solidly in the middle.</p>

            <p>We correlate low GDP with life expectancy here by highlighting only those countries with low GDP. There appears to be a relationship between life expectancy and GDP. Not a perfect one, but one seems to exist.</p>
